Recently I started exploring Emacs and it brought me joy, like a cool new toy (on the scale of the international space station). This "hobby" helped me a lot for some reason, it re-ignited a passion for tools and programming.

I decided to start a little experimental podcast to document my exploration. Hopefully, this could be interesting and/or useful for beginners and maybe even experienced users.
